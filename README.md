# thermal-resilience-assessment
Scripts used for my Building-Technology Master Thesis: "Decision-making for enhanced thermal resilience of fa√ßade-retrofits"
The research aims to improve the design process of retrofit options, increasing thermal indoor comfort during heat waves. 
Resilience indices are developed, that assess the facade's performance in identified stages of a resilient response to extreme heat. 
Based on the current state of the facade, local building standards or requirements, and realistic retrofit options, possible facacde variables can be identified as retrofit variables. 
Their possible impact is calculated using the SOBOL sensitivity analysis. Postprocessing the results, different variables per resilience stage can be identified, which can be used as an indication during the design process of the facade-retrofit. 

Workflow: 
The proposed simulation workflow requires an IDF of the current state scenario (including all relevant building parameters).
